# Race Track Simulator
This is my Bob Ross inspired "A Day at the Races" lab attempt from O'Reilly's [Head First C# book](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Learners-Real-World-Programming/dp/1449343503). It's a squirrel race gambling and betting simulator, where 3 gamblers can place bets on the squirrel they think will win the race for the potential payout of double-or-nothing! There is a minimum bet of $5 and a maximum bet of $15.

## Discussion
This was a learning exercise from the book that I thought would be more fun to customize a little with everyone's friend, Bob Ross. The book provides a summary of what the tool should do, information about the classes/methods needed, and some tips to keep in mind. However, it does not provide the source code for the lab. Although the book doesn't cover unit testing, I used this project as practice and created a number of tests that validate the class functions.

## TODO
- [x] Write tests
- [ ] Get help and 2nd opinions on the areas noted with TODO in the source code
